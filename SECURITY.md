# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

This project is developed and maintained with user safety as a priority. The goal is to provide secure, transparent, and responsible open source software for public use.

We do not support, encourage, or condone the use of this software for illegal, abusive, or unethical activities, including but not limited to social engineering, fraud, impersonation, harassment, or unauthorized access to systems or data.

We are committed to responding responsibly to security issues and to keeping the community informed when credible risks are identified.

## Responsible Use

This software is provided for legitimate and lawful purposes only. Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the software complies with applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards.

If the software is observed being actively used for illegal or malicious activities, we reserve the right to publicly warn the community, limit support, or take other appropriate actions to reduce harm.

Open source does not mean consequence free. Shocking, I know.

Users are strongly encouraged to stay on the latest supported version to receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

Send reports to
[astrodevwork@gmail.com](mailto:astrodevwork@gmail.com)

When reporting a vulnerability, include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it, if applicable
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof of concept
- The version affected

Anonymous reports are accepted. However, reports must include sufficient evidence to be considered actionable.

## Reporting Abuse or Illegal Use

If you believe this software is being used for illegal activities such as fraud or social engineering, you may report it to the same email address:

[astrodevwork@gmail.com](mailto:astrodevwork@gmail.com)

Reports must include credible evidence. Claims without verifiable information will not receive a response.

If a report is validated, we may:

- Investigate the issue internally
- Notify the community when appropriate
- Take reasonable steps to mitigate misuse

We are not law enforcement, but we are also not pretending misuse is “not our problem”.

## Response Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge valid security reports within 72 hours
- Provide updates as the issue is investigated
- Push fixes or mitigations when necessary

Response times may vary depending on severity and complexity.

## Disclosure

Confirmed vulnerabilities will be disclosed responsibly. Public disclosure will occur only after a fix or mitigation is available, unless immediate disclosure is required to protect users.
